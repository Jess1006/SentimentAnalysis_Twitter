I am developing a sentiment analysis application that leverages Twitter’s data to classify tweets into three categories: negative, neutral, and positive. This analysis aims to understand public sentiment on various topics, which could have applications in market research, political analysis, public relations, and social science research.

The use of Twitter’s API will involve:

	1.	Real-time Monitoring: Continuously fetching tweets on specified topics or hashtags to analyze emerging trends and sentiment shifts.
	2.	Historical Analysis: Accessing historical tweets to understand past sentiment trends, which can help in comparative studies and longitudinal research.
	3.	Event-driven Analysis: Focusing on tweets during specific events (like elections, product launches, etc.) to gauge public reaction and sentiment.
